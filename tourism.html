                          <h1>TOP 6 BEACHES IN INDIA</h1>
                         
                         <h4>1. 
                         GOA</h4> 
                         <img src = "C:\Users\AMAN\Desktop\hackerthon\ASD.jpg" alt = "example image" height ="500"  width = "1500" >  
                         <p>When in doubt, go Goa!  One cannot really go wrong with India’s party capital. A place where people can be seen sunbathing, swimming, parasailing or relaxing in their hammocks sipping a cold beer all year round, Goa is my first pick. In fact, Goa is the best place to kick-start your beach blast in advance with Sunburn Goa this December! Sunburn is when a conglomerate of party mongers and DJs from all over the world get together at the Candolim beach for the grandest New Year beach party. Late night parties, hypnotic music and people dancing away; Sunburn exponentially increases the fun quotient. </p>


                         <h4>2. Gokarna, Karnataka</h4> 
                         <img src = "C:\Users\AMAN\Desktop\hackerthon\a.jpg" alt = "example image" height ="500"  width = "1500" >  
                         <p>Gokarna in Karnataka is situated 190 kilometres south of Goa and makes for a wonderful change from Goa’s fast pace! Famous for the Mahabaleshwar temple and its pristine beaches, in this tranquil town, you can enjoy a day basking in the sun or laying in a hammock reading a book without distractions. Gokarna is well-connected to major cities through buses and trains and the closest airport is Dabolim Airport in Goa.  Though an important pilgrimage site, Gokarna blends religion with beach fun. Om Beach, Paradise Beach and Half-Moon Beach are the famous ones, which have both fine sand and rocky coasts mostly untouched by commercial activities. </p>
                        

                        <h4>3. Ganpatipule, Maharashtra</h4>

A tiny coastal town in Maharashtra, Ganpatipule has a grand beach, one of the most spectacular on the Konkan coast. The beach has distinctive red sand and shallow water, making it ideal for swimming. Ganpatipule can be visited en route to Ratnagiri and is just 35 kilometres from the famous Jaigad Fort, which offers a panoramic view of the sea and villages from the cliff. Ganpatipule is also famous for the Swaymbhu Ganesh temple where Lord Ganesh’s statue is believed to have originated from the ground.

Try Out: Pick up a packet of delicious Ambapoli and Phanspoli, which is delicious and similar to aam papad but made of jackfruit.
